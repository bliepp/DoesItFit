# DoesItFit
Let's imagine a common problem: You've got a closet with an angled side (or an angled room wall) and you have no idea whether your box (or cupboard) is fitting inside or not. Instead of calculating it with mathematical functions you could just type in your dimensions and try out different box sizes. Wouldn't it be great?

This program tells you if it's fitting! But remember: It also tests if it fits by rotating around the z-axis.

## Ready to go!
Just run the python program via command line. Enter your closet dimensions. Immediatly you get the optimum values.
Now you're inside an infinite loop, where you can type in box dimensions and let them test.
The program tells you whether it fits or not.
